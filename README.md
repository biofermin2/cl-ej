# cl-ej
Simple scraping script that translate English word to Japanese.

## usage
you give execute priviledge first.

~~~shellscript
$ sudo chmod +x *.ros
~~~  
if you want to translate simply, you should execute the below command line.
~~~shellscript  
$ ./cl-ej-weblio.ros [English word] or [idioms]
~~~  
if you want to know more detail, you should execute the follow line,please.
~~~shellscript  
$ ./cl-ej-alc.ros [English word] or [idioms]
~~~
but these are not smart way.

if you use these script more conviniently, 
you had better to export script path,and make alies by yourself.
Especially using bindkey and function of zsh will make you happy.

That's all.
